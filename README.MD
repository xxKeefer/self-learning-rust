# Rust Learnings

A Collection of Rust Notes and Projects I have made during my learning process, this not an indepth guide or even complete in some cases. It is a collection of notes that I made to help me learn Rust fro mmy perspect as a Typescript dev. If I already understood a concept, I did not take notes on it.

## Data Types

- **Boolean, Integer, Float and Double** : these i have seen before
- **Character** : `char` is a single unicode character, specified with single quotes
- **String** : `String` is a collection of characters, specified with double quotes. This what i normally think of as strings, the difference here is that there is a specific difference between a `char` and a `string`

## Variables

Variables assign data (a value and type) to a temporary memory location. These are immutable  by default, but can be made mutable with the `mut` keyword.

### Some examples

**Note**: The `let` keyword is used to declare a variable, and the semi colon `;` is used to end a statement and continue to the next line.

```rust
let two = 2; // this is an integer
let hello = "Hello"; // this is a string
let j = 'j'; // this is a char
let my_half = 0.5; // this is a float
let mut username = "John"; // this is a mutable string
let is_cool = true; // this is a boolean
let your_half = my_half // this sets your_half to the value of my_half
```

**Note**: Because `username` is mutable, we can change it's value, but I am not sure if your_half is a reference to my_half (like in javascript) or a copy of it.

## Functions

```rust
fn add(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 {
    x + y
}
```

- `fn` is the keyword to declare a function
- `add` is the name of the function
- `x` and `y` are the parameters. They are typed, and the type is specified after the parameter name, with a colon `:`
- `-> i32` is the return type
- `x + y` is the return value. The last line of a function is the return value, and the `return` keyword is not needed
- the opening and closing curly braces `{}` are used to define the body of the function and defines a scope

## Macros

### The `println!` macro

This is kind of the equivalent of `console.log` in javascript. It is used to print to the console.
**Note**: The `!` at the end of the macro name is used to indicate that it is a macro, and not a function.

```rust
let life = 42;
println!("Hello World!");
println!("The answer to life, the universe and everything is {:?}", life);
```

the `{:?}` is used to print the value of a variable. It is called a `placeholder` and there are many different types of placeholders. the `{:?}` indicates a debug value. There is also `{}` which is the default, and `{:#?}` which is a pretty print.
You can add as many placeholders as you want, and they will be printed in order.

```rust
let life = 42;
let name = "John";
let hug = 'O';
let kiss = 'X';
println!("Hello World! My name is {} and the answer to life, the universe and everything is {:?}", name, life);
println!("{}{}{}{}{}{}", hug, kiss, hug, kiss, hug, kiss);
```

It is also possible to inline the placeholders.

```rust
let life = 42;
println!("The meaning of life id {life:?}"); // debug version
println!("The meaning of life id {life}"); // default version

```

## Control Flow

### If Statements

`if, else, else if` : pretty much the same as in javascript, a notable difference is that the condition does not need to be wrapped in parenthesis `()`

```rust
let x = 5;
if x == 5 {
    println!("x is 5");
} else if x == 6 {
    println!("x is 6");
} else {
    println!("x is not 5 or 6");
}
```

### Loops

`loop` : this is the equivalent of a `while true` loop in javascript. It will run forever, unless you break out of it.

`while` : this is the equivalent of a `while` loop in javascript. It will run until the condition is false.

```rust
let mut x = 0;
loop {
    println!("x is {}", x);
    x += 1;
    if x == 5 {
        break;
    }
}

let mut y = 0;
while y <= 5 {
    println!("y is {}", y);
    y += 1;
}
```
